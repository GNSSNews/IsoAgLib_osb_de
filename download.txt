\section HowtoDownload Downloading the Needed Archives

As the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> provides several functions which are supplementary
or only relevant for specific conditions, the download is seperated in several
parts.

<table class="download" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" align="center">
<tr>
	<th nowrap="true">Archive</th>
    <th nowrap="true">Content Description</th>

The supplementary drivers were developed to control complete ECU IO in object oriented style
with ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> . This development patterns allows the combined control and diagnose
of IO channels with One-Channel-One-Instance relation. These driver extensions are complete optional.

All archives should be extracted from the same directory.

\subsection HowtoCreateDoc Rebuilding the Documentation with Doxygen

If you don't want to download the big archive with the generated documentation
( <b>13 MByte</b> ), you can simply recreate the documentation based on the downloaded
source and the contained informative text files.
<b>Steps:</b>
<ol>
<li>Download and install Doxygen from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ for your specific plattform
<li>Download and install graphviz with the tool "dot" from http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php
<li>Let Doxygen create the documentation with the config file "Doxyfile" which is located in the project root directory
</ol>


\section HowtoAccessRepository Accessing the Version Management Repository
The sources of the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> managed by the version management system
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> which is developed as a replacement for CVS.
The ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> repository can be accessed in read-only mode with anonymous access, so that no
registration is needed.

	- HTTP:
		- HEAD: <a href="http://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/IsoAgLib">http://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/IsoAgLib</a>
		- Releases: <a href="http://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/releases">http://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/releases</a>
	- HTTPS:
		- HEAD: <a href="https://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/IsoAgLib">https://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/IsoAgLib</a>
		- Releases: <a href="https://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/releases">https://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/releases</a>

You can access the repository by:
	- normal Browser (<a href="http://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/IsoAgLib">directly use the links above</a>)
	- with command line tools of Subversion
	- with GUI tools like rapidsvn and TortoiseSVN ( integration in Windows File Manager for very easy
		version management access )
		which can be downloaded from <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion Webiste</a> .<br>
		<b>Important:</b><br>
		Please make sure that you select the option to enable usage by all users on computer during install, as this seems to be
		no default option. Otherwise you can't use it as ordinary user on WinXP, WinNT or Win2000.<br>


<b>What to do on access problems:</b><br>
Please look at the <a href="https://linux90.idvnet.de/pipermail/isoaglib/">email list (HTTPS)</a> to see, if your problem is known.
In case your problem differs from already known cases, you should subscribe to the email list and post there your problem report.<br>
If you can only access Internet through a proxy, you have to configure subversion ( or your GUI frontend like TortoiseSVN ) to use your
proxy. See the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/svn-book.html">manual</a> for more information on
the use of subversion.<br>
If your company proxy blocks the needed WebDAV commands by default, and you can't use HTTPS for some reasons, you might look at
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_faq.html%23proxy#proxy">there</a> for a description of the needed WebDAV commands. Maybe
you can ask your proxy administrator to allow these commands to pass thru.



\section HowtoGetHelp Getting Help
As this is an Open Source project, not only the maintainers of the project can provide sufficient help for all users <b>free of charge</b>.
So either you sign a support contract to get personal support.<br>
You can also post your requests in the \ref Mailing-List.

See \ref Contributing if you want to help developing IsoAgLib further and share some ideas or work.
