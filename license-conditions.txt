\section LicenseConditions License Conditions

This Open Source project is published under License Conditions which are taken from the <a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/">eCos</a> project.
This license is defined by the FSF as GPL-compatible according to <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/license-list.html">a list of Open Source licenses</a> .
Red Hat, the original creator of the eCos, and the current maintainers of this project aimed at the following targets, as cited from their
<a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/license-overview.html">license overview page</a>:

The goal of the license is to serve the eCos user community as a whole. It allows all eCos users to develop products without paying anybody anything, no matter how many developers are working on the product or how many units will be shipped. The license also guarantees that the eCos source code will always be freely available. This applies not only to the core eCos code itself but also to any changes that anybody makes to the core. In particular, it should prevent any company or individual contributing code to the system and then later claiming that all eCos users are now guilty of copyright or patent infringements and have to pay royalties. It should also prevent any company from making some small improvements, calling the result a completely new system, and releasing this under a new and less generous license.


The license does <i>not</i> require users to release the source code of any <i>applications</i> that are developed with eCos. However, if anybody makes any changes to code covered by the eCos license, or writes new files derived in any way from eCos code, then we believe that the entire user community should have the opportunity to benefit from this. The license stipulates that these changes must be made available in source code form to all recipients of binaries based on the modified code, either by including the sources along with the binaries you deliver (or with any device containing such binaries) or with a written offer to supply the source code to the general public for three years. It is perhaps most practical for eCos developers to make the source code available online and inform those who are receiving binaries containing eCos code, and probably also the eCos maintainers, about the location of the code. See the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/ecos-license.html">text of the eCos license</a> for the most authoritative definition of the obligations.


Although it is not strictly necessary to contribute the modified code back to the eCos open source project, we are always pleased to receive code contributions and hope that developers will also be keen to give back in return for what they received from the eCos project completely free of charge. The eCos maintainers are responsible for deciding whether such contributions should be applied to the public repository. In addition, a
<a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org/assign.html">copyright assignment</a> is required for any significant changes to the core eCos packages.


The result is a royalty-free system with minimal obligations on the part of application developers. This has resulted in the rapid uptake of eCos. At the same time, eCos is fully open source with all the benefits that implies in terms of quality and innovation. We believe that this is a winning combination.

You can see the complete LICENSE terms at \ref GPL_with_exception where both the exception and
the GPL license text is presented.

You can identify the license protected parts by:<ul>
<li>Header at the top of each file
<li>Files which are placed within directories xgpl_src, build_utils and compiler_projects/projectGeneration ( all relative to root directory )
<li>README_LICENSED_PARTS.txt in each of the root directories where the license conditions of their contents is described
</ul>

<b>Important note on distinction between extensions of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> ( which are covered by the license ) and independent
Application development:</b>
The ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> uses <b>C++</b> namespaces to group internal classes, functions, types, ... in units  <i>__IsoAgLib</i> and <i>__HAL</i>,
which can be clearly seperated from their interface counterparts <i>IsoAgLib</i> and <i>HAL</i>.
Each module which uses or calls <b>directly</b> elements of the internal namespaces <i>__IsoAgLib</i> and <i>__HAL</i> is regarded as extension
of the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>.
So you must restrict your direct usage of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> parts to the interface namespaces <i>IsoAgLib</i> and <i>HAL</i>.
This causes no runtime and firmware size overhead, as the mapping between the interface elements and their corresponding internal elements
is realized by inlining, which is replaced by the compiler with direct usage of internal parts.
Please contact the maintainer <a href="mailto:a.spangler@osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a>, in case you need for some reasons direct access to internal
parts. In case your planned function is really no extension to the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>, the interface might be extended to provide the
needed access.
