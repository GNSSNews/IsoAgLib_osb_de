\subsection MaintainersExtensions Exclusive feature area for new customers and researchers
Even if ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> provides already most of the features, a agricultural device
may need, there are still some functions, that are missing or that could ease application
development. But their implementation can only be done, when people of the user community
do at least part of the work, some sponsoring companies give OSB some money to do this,
or if OSB has the option to refinance the work with surrounding customer contracts (we want
at least to avoid that our competitors take the code for free and make their own business without
even asking us).

Interested parties don't have to pay much money, as we are mostly interested in information about
everybody who uses those additional features. So don't hesitate to contact <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler@osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a>
for registration to get access to the <b>EXT</b> part of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>.

The following areas are examples for such extensions:
	- tractor data level 2 + 3 server
		- <i>iTracLight_c</i> for lightning information and control
		- <i>iTracMoveSetpoint_c</i> for control of tractor moving parameters by implement
		- <i>iTracPtoSetpoint_c</i> for control of PTO settings by implement
		- <i>iTracAux_c</i> for management of axiliary valves of tractor ( control and information )
	- additional features for virtual terminal access like multi language framework (simple definition of variable language depend parts of the mask pool)
