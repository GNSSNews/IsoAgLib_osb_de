 * This is an example of "IsoAgLib", an object oriented program library    *
 * to serve as a software layer between application specific program and   *
 * communication protocol details. By providing simple function calls for  *
 * jobs like starting a measuring program for a process data value on a    *
 * remote ECU, the main program has not to deal with single CAN telegram   *
 * formatting. This way communication problems between ECU's which use     *
 * this library should be prevented.                                       *
 * Everybody and every company is invited to use this library to make a    *
 * working plug and play standard out of the printed protocol standard.    *

    - The following loop could be replaced of any repeating call of

      which is needed to perform all internal activities of the IsoAgLib.
    - Define the time intervall for getISchedulerInstance().timeEvent()
      in a way, that allows IsoAgLib to trigger all reactions on BUS
      in the ISO 11783 defined time resolution - especially the address
      claim process has some tight time restrictions, that suggest
      a trigger rate of at least 100msec ( you could call the function
      only during address claim, mask upload and other special
      circumstances in a high repetition rate )
    - The main loop is running until iSystem_c::canEn() is returning false.
      This function can be configured by the \#define CONFIG_BUFFER_SHORT_CAN_EN_LOSS_MSEC
      in isoaglib_config.h to ignore short CAN_EN loss.
    - This explicit control of power state without automatic powerdown on CanEn loss
      can be controled with the central config define
      \#define CONFIG_DEFAULT_POWERDOWN_STRATEGY IsoAgLib::PowerdownByExplcitCall
      or
      \#define CONFIG_DEFAULT_POWERDOWN_STRATEGY IsoAgLib::PowerdownOnCanEnLoss
      in the header xgpl_src/Application_Config/isoaglib_config.h
    - This can be also controlled during runtime with the function call:
      getIsystemInstance().setPowerdownStrategy( IsoAgLib::PowerdownByExplcitCall )
      or
      getIsystemInstance().setPowerdownStrategy( IsoAgLib::PowerdownOnCanEnLoss )
