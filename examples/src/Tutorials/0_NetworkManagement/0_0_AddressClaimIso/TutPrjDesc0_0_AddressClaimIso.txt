# Optional Driver Selection
# ###############################################################

# select if the EEPROM driver shall be used, to read/write EEPROM
# data from within the IsoAgLib. This is important for local
# process data, as IsoAgLib can store intermediate values in EEPROM
# so that the value can be re-read on each system startup
# ( important for cumulative values like distance, when the
#   application has only to calculate the distance increments of the
#   current working session, and the IsoAgLib provides the cumulated
#   value on BUS;
#   it's also important to store the current SA on ISO 11783 address claim
#   --> try to reuse SA os last working session on next system start.
#       the application has only to specify to EEPROM address to handle the SA;
#       IsoAgLib takes then care of storing and reloading the SA )
# PRJ_EEPROM=0

# select if the datastreams from HAL for file input and output shall be used
# PRJ_DATASTREAMS=0

# select iRS232IO_c for RS232 output which can be used like the
# standard C++ iostreams
# PRJ_RS232=0

# select special RS232 virtual driver HAL for RS232_over_CAN
# activating this implicitly activates PRJ_RS232 with this special
# HAL driver
PRJ_RS232_OVER_CAN=1

# select iDigitalO_c ( one instance/variable of this class per channel )
# for digital On/Off input
# ( provides automatic range check which uses diagnose function of HAL
#  - BIOS/OS - to check if current is in allowed interval );
# use iActorO_c for global access to all active iDigitalO_c instances
# PRJ_SENSOR_DIGITAL=0

# select iAnalogI_c for analog ( current or voltage ) sensor input.
# or iAnalogIRangeCheck_c with enhanced automatic range check
# PRJ_SENSOR_ANALOG=0

# select iCounterI_c for counter input.
# the existing HAL implementations ( e.g. for ESX ) extend the BIOS/OS
# function, as a IsoAgLib specific event counting for very low
# event repetition rates is provided - the BIOS version is only
# designed for typical RPM values
# PRJ_SENSOR_COUNTER=0

# select if the digital output driver shall be integrated into the project.
# you can then use the HAL of IsoAgLib to realize a mostly hardware independend
# access on PWM output. This is completely independent from communication tasks,
# but was created during research and is actively used by OSB AG for its own
# projects

#  - BIOS/OS - to check if current is in allowed interval );
# use iActorO_c for global access to all active iDigitalO_c instances

# select if the EEPROM driver shall be used, to read/write EEPROM
# data from within the IsoAgLib. This is important for local
# process data, as IsoAgLib can store intermediate values in EEPROM
# so that the value can be re-read on each system startup
# ( important for cumulative values like distance, when the
#   application has only to calculate the distance increments of the
#   current working session, and the IsoAgLib provides the cumulated
#   value on BUS;
#   it's also important to store the current SA on ISO 11783 address claim
#   --> try to reuse SA os last working session on next system start.
#       the application has only to specify to EEPROM address to handle the SA;
#       IsoAgLib takes then care of storing and reloading the SA )

# activating this implicitly activates PRJ_RS232 with this special
# HAL driver
PRJ_RS232_OVER_CAN=1

# select iDigitalO_c ( one instance/variable of this class per channel )
# for digital On/Off input
# ( provides automatic range check which uses diagnose function of HAL
#  - BIOS/OS - to check if current is in allowed interval );
# use iActorO_c for global access to all active iDigitalO_c instances
# PRJ_SENSOR_DIGITAL=0

# select iAnalogI_c for analog ( current or voltage ) sensor input.
# or iAnalogIRangeCheck_c with enhanced automatic range check
# PRJ_SENSOR_ANALOG=0

# select iCounterI_c for counter input.
# the existing HAL implementations ( e.g. for ESX ) extend the BIOS/OS
