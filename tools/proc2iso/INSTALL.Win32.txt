Parsing device descriptions using proc2iso.exe
==============================================
proc2iso.exe needs a specified xml schema file as parameter. You can use the 
included proc2iso.xsd file or specify a different one.

usage:
  proc2iso.exe -s=[ful relative path to fobar.xsd] [XML device description file]
or:
  call "proc2iso.cmd" directly from where your [device description].xml file is
  stored and the proc2iso.xsd that is in the same directory as proc2iso.exe will
  be used by default.

Please note that specifying an absolute path within the parameters of 
proc2iso.exe might not work (so just use the batch file)!


Further Information
===================
proc2iso needs to be adapted/enhanced in the near future, so the current state
is not optimal, but working. It will be cleaned up when work on proc2iso
continues (there are many obsolete files in this folder like "configure", etc.
- just ignore them for now)
