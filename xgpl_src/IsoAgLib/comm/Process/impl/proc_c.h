 * This file is part of the "IsoAgLib", an object oriented program library *
 * to serve as a software layer between application specific program and   *
 * communication protocol details. By providing simple function calls for  *
 * starting a measuring program for a process data value on a Remote ECU,  *
 * remote ECU, the main program has not to deal with single CAN telegram   *
 * formatting. This way communication problems between ECU's which use     *
 * this library should be prevented.                                       *
 * Everybody and every company is invited to use this library to make a    *
 * working plug and play standard out of the printed protocol standard.    *
