\section UsingProjects Known Projects that use IsoAgLib
As the used license <i>GPL with exception</i> requires from each user to accompany any distributed Program
( or a work based on it - see GPL &sect;3 ) with some information on the used library, it would be quite kind to
inform additionally the authors of your project, so that each using project can be listed here.
This list can also serve as a prominent place for showing all contributing ( by money and/or code ) users.<br>

Last but not least, projects which use features like process data communication based on ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> will
probably have less compatibility problems than in other combinations. This gets the more important, the more implements,
sensors, task controllers, core control units ( expert system ) and tractor builds more and more complex
interaction networks with all sorts of dependencies. Here ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> can provide common patterns for the
management of such interactions. This list can then help to identify well supported device combinations.<br>

The <a href="http://www.isoaglib.com/">Commercial Overview Page</a> of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> has a
<a href="http://www.isoaglib.com/customer-agco.html">list of commercial products which use ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i></a>.


The ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> will be actively maintained by <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler@osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a> at <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a>
as long as the invested time is affordable in relation to corresponding projects and support contracts.<br>
Even in case the active maintenance by <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> might be stopped some day, the GPL license and
the independent website at the
<a href="http://www.tec.wzw.tum.de/pflanztech/englisch/index.html">Department of Bio Resources and Land Use Technology - Crop Production Engineering</a>
assure that any interested party can step in and continue the maintenance of the project. This guarantees, like in other Open Source projects, the
open access for every user. <br>
Also, in case the major part of the user community is unsatisfied with the maintenance by <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a>, it is
normal for Open Source projects like ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> to fork the project as a last resort, if <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a>
can't or doesn't want to change the style of maintenance as requested. As far as possible, <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a>
will do everything to avoid such a fork.<br>
A comparable fork was performed by users and developers of the X11R6 server project for UNIX style operating systems - <b>XFree86</b>.
Caused by some licensing issues, a fork of the <a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a> was created by the <a href="http://X.Org">X.Org Foundation</a>,
which also appreciated by several graphic card manufacturers, as they can integrate their drivers with the new management method in a better way.
<br>
&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>
This way it is assured under all conditions, that the development time and money, which is invested in an application that uses the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>
can't be affected by the style and quality of future project maintenance.
