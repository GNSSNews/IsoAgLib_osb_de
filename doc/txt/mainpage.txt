\section Changes Changes

\subsection Change_Q 2.1.2 to 2.2.0
 Repository restructuring:
 - All tools (including can_server) can now be found in the "tools" directory. Added the logalizer (can-log analyzer) tool.
   All needed libraries need to be put in the corresponding "tools/libs/<libname>" directory.
 - Removed "library/simulated_io"
 - Removed all svn:externals, no more user-authentication-checkout-problems:
   * Complete Tractor Data and Proprietary PGN handling now available to the public.
   * All commercial_BIOS externals removed. If you need to build for an embedded target,
     copy the BIOS files into the commercial_BIOS folder on your own, request access to the BIOS-repository at OSB's subversion-server
     or change the BIOS path in your conf_<projectname> file to the path where you have the BIOS already installed.
 - Restructured doc/html: Now there's an API and an ALL documentation
 - Cleanup of root and admin directory

 Tutorial:
 - Added new Tutorial Network ECU Display with ecu_main (including main-loop) and its three components.
 - Removed obsolete examples.

 Diagnostics Services (ISO 11783-Part 12):
 - Added support in (i)IdentItem_c for Basic Diagnostics Services: ECU-Identification, SW-Identification, Certification-Data. 

 Tools:
 - Improved output of the different tools such as CAN-Server, logalizer, update_makefile.sh, etc.
 - Enhanced logalizer with printing out ASCII and proper display of TP/ETP sessions. Also LANGUAGE_PGN decoding added.
 - Enhanced can_messenger with implementation of period and repeat parameter

 VT-Client:
 - Fixed bug in vt input element selection/pointing event callback-message.
 - vtObjectAlarmMask_c::setSoftKeyMask(NULL) did crash. Now correctly checks NULL-pointer as done in vtObjectDataMask_c.
 - Now adding language-code to the versionlabel if >= 1 languages
 - Added sendChangeActiveMaskCommand to iVtClientservercommunication
 - First simple support for WS slaves added.
 - Fixed signature of iVtObjectStringVariable_c::setValueCopy(char*..)
 - Allow unscaled pool upload via PROPRIETARY_NO_POOL_SCALING define
 
 TC-Client / ProcessData:
 - Removed Float-Processdata and some old DIN-relicts
 - MeasureProgLocal_c::processMsg(): use backuped sender IsoName for processTcStatusMsg(), sendValForGroup() and processDefaultLoggingStart()
 - Comparison between LanguageLabels using operator< was wrong (only occurred in multi-language device descriptions]
 - Allow proprietary DevPropertyHandler
 - Fixed timing on TC-Client alive if the minimum time-dist is >2sec.

 vt2iso:
 - Added SilentMode, Object-IDs/KeyCodes are being grouped into namespace now, too - Generated DEFINEs changed to static const unsigned int.
 - Added -a / -a=abc parameter: Now using ProjectName from VTP for filename per default, if not overridden using -a/-a=abc
 - Added -x=prefix parameter: Generated language-objects can now get a prefix. iVtObjectX_1 => iVtObjectX_prefix1
 - Added option to provide an xml search path (-d= | -D=) [Attention: Usage() does not tell about the switch to avoid confusion!]
 - Enhanced informational output
 - put "Overriding values" warning into verbose mode.
 - -o=dir doesn't need to have the separator in it anymore.
 - Optimization for ROM-size usage: -functions.inc does now use a _sROM-list and a loop to initialize the iVtObject_c-instances.
 - Enhancement: Added eventPartialPoolUploaded()-handler.
 - "-direct"-files are NO MORE generated. Please switch to only using the "-derived"-files! (Please remove any old "-direct.inc" files to avoid confusion

 - Don't overwrite object-selection if no change of content
 - Fixed wrong generated code which didn't compile when using the "externalize"-option

 proc2iso:
 - Removed need for 'device_program_name' tag in <device> element, as it's currently unused

 can_server:
 - Cleaned output.
 - Added build-instructions for can_server with several CAN-devices
 - Enhancement: Introduced run modes "interactive" and "productive". Please refer to can_server for the usage description. (Interactive will be default)
 - Enhancement: Allowing multiple Busses with Sontheim and Socket-CAN-Server
 - Enhancement: Added support for Linux SocketCAN. Currently via CAN-Server. (Later via direct HAL)
 - Fix: WIN32: "send: no error"-message doesn't appear after disconnecting clients all the time in a loop anymore.

 - Fix: Growing timestamp list in PEAK PCAN card device
 - Cleanup on (sleep-)timings and readFromBus strategy.

 update_makefile.sh
 - Removed Dev-C++ Support as Dev-C++ is a discontinued product. Focussing on Visual Studio Project-file generation instead.
 - Introduced "conf_template" as template for own project configurations. Originating from former examples' conf-files, but cleaned up / restructured.
 - Makefiles will no more automatically build a can_server-binary. The can_server-binary is available prebuilt in different
   flavors in the "bin" folder - thus removed USE_CAN_DEVICE_FOR_SERVER.
 - Project-defines with NAME=VALUE now properly generated into config_xy.h, too. (Gave warnings before)
 - Removed unit-test generation and outputting help if run without parameters
 - Added "conf_template" as basis to use for own projects.
 - Removed creation (and usage in isoaglib_config.h) of "version.h", which actually should be an application issue rather than an ISOAgLib issue.
 - Add new platform P1MC and CCS project handling
 - Improved generation speed.
 - New options --report and --report=REPORT_FILE. Separate reports from standard output in case the user wants this.
 - Change: Removed ISO_TERMINAL_SERVER support in update_makefile.sh - Use PRJ_MULTIPACKET and USE_WORKING_SET instead.
 - Removed senseless CAN_BUS_USED define in .txt/conf_/config_/update_makefile.sh
 - If wrong option/configuration is given, bail out instead of trying to adapt the option.
 - Fixed bug reported by Andy Skeel: LIBPATH = -LONELIBRARY -LANOTHERLIBRARY.
 - Fixed problem when using APP_PATH_EXCLUDE
 - Fixed problem in Tasking generation when multiple pathes are used. Now using semicolon in include path rather than comma
 - Fixed problem in gathering files given by APP_SRC_EXCLUDE

 General Enhancements:
 - Adding new function to determine how many devices on the bus have a certain deviceclass and function.
 - Added the HALSimulator_c class to allow the application layer to handle HAL functions or print CAN communication.
 - Interface "iSchedulerTask_c" enhanced for setting the timePeriod and earlier/latest interval.
 - FastPacket now available in iMultiSend_c
 - Optimization: IsoMonitor_c: Remove obsolete/unnecessary std::vector.sort()
 - Adapt IsoAgLib for target without 8 bit char type (Add new NO_8BIT_CHAR_TYPE define for target that do not have 8 bit char type)
 - Added subset of Boost C++ libraries. Improved README files. Listed where libraries are used within IsoAgLib.
 - Addition of EES HAL
 - PC-HAL: Allow FLOAT_WORD_ORDER to be officially set with global DEFINEs

 General Fixes:
 - TimePosGps_c: Fixed crash when calling localHour() at a very early stage (getTime() == 0) under Windows
 - TimePosGps_c: Added missing Long-modifier for calculations like 60*60*24, did overrun on 16bit systems.
 - TimePosGps_c: Was not properly handling different senders for Trac/GPS
 - CAN-HAL: Standard Identifier CAN-messages weren't handled properly
 - CAN-HAL PC: Fixed out of bounds array access
 - CanIo_c: Change, so that next call continues search in canMsg2FilterBox.
 - MultiSend: Fixing CTS-request while sending burst:
   * MultiSend cleaned up. TP/ETP are now handled more similar.
   * CTS while burst-sending is now handled correctly, too.
   * CTS can retrieve any position in Buffer
   * CTS can retrieve start or in middle of last burst when using MultiSendStreamer
   * Request-check now enhanced. Not only position is checked to be in-range, but also the length is considered now (can we supply all the queried data?)
 - Functionality-Fix: Address-Claiming: Removed the 2500ms wait on AddressClaiming when no other item online to act normal with 1250ms.
 - AddressClaim: Now correctly handling AddressStealing in the 250ms-phase
 - Ident_c::masked def.param: Corrected wrong default parameter
 - Windows RS232-HAL: Fixed first instance 0 to be COM1 instead of COM0
 - Using consequently COMx instead of //./COMx. Both should work of course.
 - PC-EEPROM: Cleaned up DEBUG-statements and Code
 - CAN-Reception Overflow with default value: Default CAN-Receive buffer increased from 16 to 256 messages
   (Caused problems when just too many messages were on the bus - in that example
   56 address-claim messages were received, but the buffer of 16 was just too small.)
 - PC Sensor HAL: If simulated sensor-input-file was missing, it crashed
 - ECU didn't come up at all if secondly addressclaim-request was on the bus
 - Logalizer Output on Win32: Timestamp output is fixed now, using correct lli instead of Li
 - TP/ETP-Sending: Faster Cleanup of SendStream / Forbid ConnAbort on Finished Streams
 - iGenericData: Add default member in c'tors
 - Forbid copy construction of ProprietaryMessageClient_c
 - API-Fix in iMultiReceive_c: Added some missing 'MultiReceive_c::' qualifiers (resulted in self-calling endless-loop)
 - API-Enhancement in MultiReceive_c: Added methods to configure MultiReceive-timings: MultiReceive_c::setCtsDelays & MultiReceive_c::setExperimentalTimings
 - API-Change in iIsoName_c/IsoName_c: Changed behavior of default constructor iIsoName_c()/IsoName_c()
 - IsoMonitor: deleteIsoMember for Local Network Nodes ((i)IdentItem_c) did not take the cached active local item into account,
   hence it was dangling to some old memory and caused strange behavior
 - Proprietary-Message-Handling: Fixed registering with a NULL IdentItem

 ...and of course several warning-cleanups as found with newer compilers and lint...


\subsection Change_P 2.1.1 to 2.1.2
 vt2iso:
 - More stable on wrong input
 - Support for VT-Designer Project files.
 - objectpointer value="" should not be parsed as 0 but NULL.
 - High object-IDs can now be set directly without having ID-collisions with automatically-numbered objects.
   (All given IDs are scanned in a first pass, so they are skipped in auto-numbering)
 - You should now be able to call vt2iso also from an other directory than the one where there .vtp file resides.
 - Console output is cleaned up. Use -m option for a verbose output now.
 - Fixing crash (mostly under Windows) when <macro> objects were used.
 - IsoTerminalObjectSelection.inc was renamed to <projectname>-objectselection.inc
 - Option -o to generate the files to a different directory than the XML/VTP dir.
 - Option -g added to allow output to be grouped into namespace BLA { [...] }
 - Check all option attributes for exact match or return error
 - remove "_" in following attribute values for better naming scheme:
   wrap_on_hyphen, valid_characters, invalid_characters, no_fill, not_used,
   suppress_border, transparent_background, no_border, live_editing
 - Enhanced buffer for bitmaps for special use, now larger than the old buffer of 480x480 pixels.
   (Even though larger bitmaps don't make much sense in "normal" clients)
 - Now converting directory separators to native platform in given paths.

 proc2iso:
 - DPT in Bytestream was wrongly generated:
   Property Value field was 4 bytes ASCII instead of 4 byte integer. (r3842)

 Documentation:
 - VT-Client XML-Description:
   auxinput changed to auxiliaryinput.
   auxfunction changed to auxiliaryfunction.

 CAN-Server:
 - (msq version): if directory "/root" is not useable for key generation (ftok),

 - provide proper initialization for Scheduler_Task_c::mb_alreadyClosed in constructor. Suggested By: Joel Morton (r3801)
 - MeasureProgBase_c: Fix that the correct SA is used in all commands which follow immediately init()
   (and not only commands after addSubProg() is called) (r3825)
 - Fix in FilterBox_c: bool was used for the return type of fifo_useMsgObjGet instead of int32_t. (r3828)
 - Process_c: Crashed (at least) in Windows when unregisterRemoteProcessData set
   the searchCacheIterator wrongly in case of an empty list. (r3838)
 - MultiSend-Retry: Wrong Sequence-Nr. was used. It was not reset along with the re-sending of the last burst.

   count from program-start with 0 (instead of returning some absolute time), just as in the linux-case. (r3699)
 - Enhance LittleEndian input stream parsing in util_funcs. (r3821)
 - Added (i)TracFacilities_c class to add support for Tractor Facilities.
 - WinCE-Support built in.

   clearAlreadyClosed(), setAlreadyClosed(), checkAlreadyClosed() (r3705)
 - Improvement of update_makefile.sh on Tasking project file generation and more
 - External references hooked to fix-revision numbers now, so checking out an older version is now consistent

 Cleanup:

  - integrate option to add application specific include paths in conf_xy file

\subsection Change_L 1.2.1 to 1.2.2(unofficial)

  - support for proc2iso XML schema: new mandatory parameter -s=xxx.xsd for personalized path to xsd-file (see proc2iso --help).
    former only -s with a default path
  - support for processdata designators up to 30 chars to enable a differentiation between the deviceprocessdatacombination (DDI groups)
  - added special class IsoRequestPgn_c to answer REQUEST_PGN_MSG_PGN appropriate if any other class registered for that filter could not answer

\subsection Change_K 1.2.0 to 1.2.1

	- fixes for Win32 RS232 HAL
	- added the hook function eventVtStatusMsg() that gets called immediately after recognizing an incoming VT status message
	- fix compilation problems for cases with more than one protocoll instance
	- project generation can now selectively incorporate tractor information subgroup classes, enhance the tractor information bases classes
	- implemented possibility to change ISONAME of a device during runtime for DeviceDescription upload to TaskController
	- Added explicit MultiPacket enabling in update_makefile.sh. Added getLinearBuffer function to StreamLinear_c
	- include devpropertyhandler_c (DeviceDescription handling) only in projects which use LOCAL Process Data
	- different font used for outputstrings in buttons to enable different scaling factors depending on the size of the button
	- iProcDataLocalSimpleSetpoint_c::init() and iProcDataLocalSimpleMeasure_c::init() bugfix
	- periodic SA request (about one minute period) for early detect of lost nodes on the BUS to get early cleanup of monitor list
	  ( this feature is only active, when the automatic deletion of stale ISO nodes is activated by <tt>\#define CONFIG_ISO_ITEM_MAX_AGE > 0</tt> )
	- Now supporting differentially scaled fontattributes in buttons
	- Changed Scaling to get more exact. removed 20bit fixpoint by factorM and factorD
	- Softkey child object positioning revised
	- fix useage of CAN last message object which is used to receive CAN messages while the normal message objects are reconfigured
	- give an ISOItem a second chance on a missed SA-Request; trigger periodic SA-Request every minute to get rid of stale entries in the monitor list
	- fix calculation of analog ADC voltage value to the correct formula given by ESX BIOS

\subsection Change_J 1.1.0 to 1.2.0

	- ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> is meanwhile used for several commercial projects, and more people are using it, so that
	  the overall quality is raised to a fairly well level
	- Vector-Informatik CAN card drivers can now be used with Dev-C++ due to new version of <b>their</b> driver (Please check Vector-Informatik
	  download page for details)
	- Process data communication is now update to the new ISO 11783 format
	- XML based definition of Device Description
	- creation of directly compileable Device Description with tool <b>proc2iso</b> which creates also the
	  class instantiations for all defined local process data, so that the list of construction parameters needn't be
		managed by hand
	- Upload of Device Description corresponding to current state of Task Controller standardization
	- fully functional support of Task Controller Client
	- Multi-Receive is now supported, so that Input Text fields can be used in Virtual Terminal masks without restriction
	- new Linux CAN HAL driver uses Linux kernel message queues for CAN communication between several local applications
	  with or without real CAN cards --> several applications can easily constitude a CAN BUS without any hardware
	- class GetyPos_c was renamed to DevKey_c to express the meaning for users who don't know DIN 9684
	- new HAl adaptations to further <b>STW</b> ECU types supported by users
	- proper support of NMEA2000 GPS strings
	- several enhancements regarding VT client and network management
	- XML-Schema pre-validation of vt2iso XML files
	- Softkey size can now also be specified (sk_width="..." sk_height="...", just like the datamask-size (dimension="...")
	- Adapted many items (timeouts, font-encoding, Positions now SIGNED integer) to FIRST EDITION of 11783-Part 6 (Virtual Terminal)
	- "vtKeyCodeESC" is now "vtKeyCodeACK"
	- vt2iso: Filename-parameter doesn't need "./" prefixed any more if XML file is in current directory
	- minor fixes in IsoTerminal_c's close(), changeNumericValue's reserved byte changed to 0xFF
	- NACK-recognition implemented (eventEnterSafeState), although it needs some more testing
	- reaction on language (change) PGN now possible via hook-function
	- old class Base_c is subdivided into smaller classes, so that a project can better select the wanted information types.
		This allows also the better maintenance of anonymous accessible parts (most of the features existing in pre-1.2.0 release)
		and special extansions, that is only possible by personal access. Please contact  <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a>
		to gain access to the extension parts.

\subsection Change_I 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

	- now using specific LAST CAN MESSAGE OBJECT of CAN controllers to store CAN messages
		during CAN reconfiguration process for later process ( avoid loss of messages )<br>
		this is important to receive the very early triggered <b>ISO 11783</b> command <b>Request for Claimed Addresses</b>
	- the script update_makefile.sh was extended to create also Microsoft Visual Studio VC++ version 6.0 DSP files;
		This needs the installation of STLport if VC6 is used, see \ref Vc6StlPort for more information.
	- provided automatic CAN CARD HW selection for Vector-Informatik CAN CARDs so that:
		- either all CAN channels of real CAN cards can be counted
		- or just the CAN channels of the special virtual CAN device can be counted ( if no real CAN card is connected )
	- add driver for <b>Sontheim CAN cards</b> ( tested only with CANLPT, but in theory designed according general API documentation, as all card
		differences are handled by the driver, <b>extract the files from the Sontheim API ZIP in the directory <i>C:\\Development\\Sontheim</i> if you want to
		use the tutorial project files without changes</b> )
	- adapted the check for new messages in Win32 CAN cards to RTE style
	- added basic language handling and AUX functions handling into ISO Terminal
	- added <b>ISO 11783 Virtual Terminal</b> connection management, so that the pool is automatically
		reloaded on reconnection ( changed terminal properties are regarded )
	- done several cleanups and additions to <b>ISO 11783 Virtual Terminal</b>
	- enhance documentation for feature setup files for individual projects and reorganize the existing files, to make them easier to understand
	- enable HTTPS access to the subversion repository, as some proxies might hinder WebDAV access, which is needed by Subversion/Apache2<br>
		so please try HTTPS access in case you have problems with accessing the repository, before you contact <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a>
	- some cleanup of workarounds which are needed due to Tasking compiler faults - the STL of versions up to 7.56 have wrong includes
		( see file "include.cpp/algorithm" which includes "include.cpp/stl_algobase.h" which includes "string.h" into global namespace;
		  a C++ system header shall include C-Library functions into the "std::" namespace -> it should include <tt>\<cstring\></tt> instead;
			other compilers do this correct )
	- introduce config setting for project config to select HEAP allocation strategy:
		- either allocate chunks of items ( for Tasking: 40 items per chunk ) to avoid HEAP defragmentation and to avoid memory allocation runtime as long as no new chunk is
			needed, which doesn't happen for most use cases, as the chunk size is pretty big in relation to the awaited numbers of mostly smaller than 10 items
		- or directly call malloc on each item creation, which causes greater overhead per item ( linkage of all malloced blocks in HEAP, whereas the chunks have a
			pretty efficient organization structure ) and which can cause longer malloc execution time on each item creation ( can be important, if large amount
			of monitor list entries, several measurement programs, setpoints occure, or if CAN filter setting must be reconfigured due to configuration change )
		- <b>PREFER CHUNK ALLOCATION AS LONG AS HEAP OVERHEAD IS ACCEPTIBLE, USE OTHER METHOD ONLY FOR RESTRICTED HEAP MEM CONDITIONS</b>
	- avoid allocation of HEAP for elements of temporal IsoAgLib::ManageMeasureProgLocal_c instances ( create default IsoAgLib::MeasureProgLocal_c instances on first real access )
	- optimize HEAP memory item size debug messages, so that real HEAP usage is reflected ( including overhead due to memory block linking in HEAP )<br>
			Thanks to the help of Tasking support ( information on simple integration of _malloc.c into EDE projects )
	- change <b>update_makefile.sh</b> shell script to avoid calls to <b>perl</b> functions, as these are only part of standard LINUX systems, and are <b>not</b>
		part of <b>MSYS</b> system ; additionally replace UNIX style directory seperation from slash to backslash for Win32 compilers and use Windows stly newline
	- change device types and CAN channels of tutorial examples, so that e.g. 1_0_ReadIso.cpp and 1_2_WriteIso.cpp can interact ( <b>a)</b> different device types
		for both ECUs and <b>b)</b> different CAN channels so that two channels of one PC CAN card can be connected )
	- unify number intervals of CAN HAL for BUS and MsgObj numbers to start with <b>0</b> for each type of HAL ( avoid HAL dependent offset constants ).
	- change default path for Win32 CAN card manufacturer driver library files ( API DLLs and Headers ) to <i>C:\\Development</i> so that all users can install their
		driver files to the corresponding location, if they want to avoid changing all default VC++ project files ( if pathes like <i>C:\\Development\\CANLIB</i> are still
		not acceptable, update_makefile.sh can be used to create VC++ DSP files based on adapted conf_x_y project feature setup files )
	- fix bug in handling of counter input, which prevented ESX BIOS counting functions from correct work ( these functions work only if now application IRQ handler is specified )
	- fix bug in handling of PWM output diagnose ( the state detection didn't work right ) and move this diagnose function in new
		ESX HAL file actor_target_extensions.cpp
	- add note on selection of right Vector-Informatik CAN card driver ( the "XL Driver Library" is not coupled to the "XL" CAN cards;
		you can use a XL CAN card with the CANLIB driver API also - this is the case for all users the maintainers know to date --> vector_canlib is
		the right selection in the conf_foo feature setup files )

\subsection Change_H 1.0.0rc5 to 1.0.0

	- implemented all virtual terminal object types, which are defined in ISO 11783 ( thanks to Brad Cox )
	- implemented simple access function for easy change control of Vt-Object attributes like colour

\subsection Change_G 1.0.0rc4 to 1.0.0rc5

	- added trigger request for claimed address as soon as local Ident is initialized as ISO 11783
		( avoid <DeviceType, DeviceTypeInst> clash in IsoAgLib::IsoMonitor_c )
	- implemented GPS decoding for ISO 11783 based on open accessible sources ( thanks to google )
		( please test and send changes, in case a reference system reveals wrong decoding;
			decoding of Longituge and Latitude are most probably correct, others?? )
			- CAN ID 0x00FFF3LU with GPS_STATE_PGN -> probably the GPS mode is in BYTE1???
			- CAN ID 0x00FEF3LU with GPS_LATITUDE_LONGITUDE_PGN -> a google'd example shows positioning and unit of latitude and longitude
			- CAN ID 0x00FEE8LU with GPS_SPEED_HEADING_ALTITUDE_PGN -> probably last 4 Bytes contain altitude
	- extended definition possibilities for application sources in project building script <b>update_makefile.sh</b>
	- fixed bug in vt2iso.cpp which prevented it creating bitmap arrays for the 480 resolution
	- fixed bug in FreeImage library handling, which places Y scanlines upsidedown in relation to
		"usual" graphic algorithms -> thus the bitmaps were flipped vertically

\subsection Change_F 1.0.0rc3 to 1.0.0rc4

	- reordered main documentation blocks
	- changed device type of virtual terminal example to tillage so that
		conflicts with the tractor instance of CANoe are avoided

\subsection Change_E 1.0.0rc2 to 1.0.0rc3

	- added support for Vector Informatik CAN driver libraries <b>CANLIB</b> and <b>XL Driver Library</b>
		( integrate it in the project generation script, so that a Dev-C++ project can be simply created )
	- made management of Master Working Set state of a local IsoAgLib::IdentItem_c ( representing of local ISO 11783
		node in the library ) more robust against SA and Device Type conflicts
	- enhanced some documentation
	- fixed some small problems in interaction with CANoe virtual terminal ( thanks to Brad Cox )

\subsection Change_D 1.0.0rc1 to 1.0.0rc2

	- added several features to the project generation script to create project
		files for the Open Source Win32 IDE "Dev-C++" and for the Tasking EDE
	- enhanced documentation ( esp. Getting Started Guide, extended HTML links in examples
		to demonstrated features )
	- renamed all usages of "Announce" to the more standard conformant "Address Claim" and
		change "DPlus" to "CanEn" to make ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> terms easier to understand
	- enhanced overall integration into Win32 ( thanks to the help of Brad Cox )
	- integrated the virtual terminal mask handling tool <b>vt2iso</b> to Win32 build
		with Dev-C++ ( added alternative image manipulation library usage for <b>Free Image</b> )

\subsection Change_C 0.2.1 to 1.0.0rc1

	- reorganization of source files
	- ISO 11783 at larger extend:
	    - working set messages
			- virtual terminal
			- process data state of Spring 2003
			- some bugs of first ISO approach fixed
	- extended documentation with several examples and diagrams
	- global access to central service classes to avoid complicated access through several steps
	- reduced usage of heap memory
	- reorganized error handling
	- better integration in time schedule of application, as main function for periodic actions of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> allows
	    now to define a final time of return, where ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> returns at latest to the application
	- smarter structure of namespaces
	- several variants of process data, to restrict resource usage to needed level by selection of process data
	    type, which provides exactly the needed features
	- simple integration of process data and local identity variables within the program scope -> better control of memory and activation

\subsection Change_B 0.2.0 to 0.2.1

	- corrected some small errors of synchronisation between working 0.1.0 tree and the new 0.2.0
	- fixed bug in process data list management

\subsection Change_A 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

	- optional basic set of <b>ISO 11783</b> features
	- possibility of baud rate auto sensing on power up and on BUS OFF errors (with configurable wait time).
	- partitioning of sources in different packages. A base package contains system management, base tractor information
			and CAN driver. All optional modules like process data or EEPROM driver can now
			be downloaded as separate source archives.
	- ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> specific CAN driver module to ease hardware adaptation
	- collection of all files which must be edited for hardware adaptation to one directory and reduction of the amount
			of affected files
