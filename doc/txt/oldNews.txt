\subsection News_E New for the 2.0 release
  - <b>December 2006:</b> Support of PEAK CAN cards for Linux development hosts
  - <b>October 2006:</b> Integrate enhanced scheduler, which plans exact reschedule times for all periodic subtasks of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>, so that other program items
     exactly know when the timeEvent() function of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> has to be called again.
  - <b>September 2006:</b> <b>ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i></b> now is a real ISO library! Complete removal of all DIN-related or DIN-dependent code, classes and preprocessor directives.
    The following steps had to be done:
    + remove all unneeded DIN9684 and all its #ifdefs
    + merge ISONAME_c and DevKey_c to the new ISONAME_c as the only
      class to represent the device key
    + merge SystemMgmt_c and IsoMonitor_c to the new IsoMonitor_c class
      so that it hosts both all IdentItem_c (as list of pointers)
      and does also maintain list of all ECUs on the BUS
      --> all Network Management is done by this IsoMonitor_c class right
      now
    + optimize adress resolving for process data send, as some helper functions
      were only needed for the DIN way of life
    + optimize the TP send and receive classes, as several action flows were
      only needed for the parallel support of DIN, ISO and Fieldstar/LBS+ TP

\subsection News_D Planned changes for 2.0.1 release
  - there are currently no planned changes on interface side for 2.0.1 release
  - CAN HAL will get its own central message FIFO implementation, to get better load balancing and message processing in order as received

\subsection News_C News for the 1.2.1 release
  - <b>February 2006:</b> Enhance modularization of base information (Not-ProcessData parts from 11783-7) - this will be finished for release 1.2.2
  - <b>January 2006:</b> Periodic Source Adress (SA) request sending to get early cleanup of stale nodes in monitor list
  - <b>18.1.2006:</b> Virtual Terminal Client<br>
    - Now supporting correct scaling of the button-contents! (Each bThe layered structure is described by the following diagram:
inline_dotgraph_1
Information on Obligatory Elemutton has its own scaling-factor/centering-offset as the border is always 4 absolute 4 pixel, independent of how the object-pool will be scaled!)
      <b>ATTENTION: Please REBUILD vt2iso and RERUN it on your project's XML-definition, the initAllObjects function in the generated -functions.inc has changed!!<br>
    - Also new due to this slightly different scaling in the buttons: Don't use the same fontattributes-object in the datamask AND a button. Also (from a strict point of view) don't use the same fontattributes-object in different-sized buttons (as they all got a slightly different scaling-factor)!!!</b><br>
    - Please recheck all your fixed-bitmaps in your projects (if using any), because the scaling-routine has slightly changed, which may result in size-differences by 1 pixel - this may lead to NOT finding a matching fixed-bitmap anymore!

\subsection News_B News for the 1.2.0 release
    - <b>during 2005:</b> Virtual Terminal Client<br>
        - <b>ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i></b> has now its own internet domains: http://www.isoaglib.org , http://www.isoaglib.de and http://www.isoaglib.com
        - Added support for IsoLatin-9 fonts: Now for every font-attribute the "font_type" attribute has to be specified. (Please adapt your existing XML files.)<br>
        - Support for font-downscaling (in case a pool is designed for >200x200 pixel VTs)<br>
        - Cleanup on Tutorial3_0 example objectpool
        - Several more handler functions, for more information see "Changes" section below<br>
        - Vector-Informatik supports now the Open Sourve IDE <b>Dev-C++</b>, so that you don't need Microsoft compilers to get the tutorials to run with real CAN hardware on Win32.
        - New area of customer only extension modules. Specific extansions like complete level 2 and 3 Tractor ECU Client and Server support need several additional functions, that
            are at the moment only implemented by <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de/">OSB</a> and nobody else from the user community. Thus we don't want to give it for free to anonymous
            parties (including our competitors). Researchers and potential customer may ask <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler@osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a> for granting personal access
            to the repository.
    - <b>2005-March:</b> MultiReceive classes implemented.

\subsection News_A News before the 1.1.0 release
	- <b>2004-11-15:</b> Create new email list for email exchange within user community so that users can help each other, and
		can discuss changes there, before somebody starts implementing the change<br>
		- subscribe at <a href="http://linux90.idvnet.de/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/isoaglib">http://linux90.idvnet.de/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/isoaglib</a>
		- access the archive of all emails at <a href="http://linux90.idvnet.de/pipermail/isoaglib/">http://linux90.idvnet.de/pipermail/isoaglib/</a>
	- <b>2004-11-18:</b> Add creation of <b>Microsoft Visual C++ V6.0</b> project files to update_makefile.sh , as <b>Dev-C++</b> can't build EXE files which are running with
		Vector-Informatik CAN cards
	- <b>2004-11-23:</b> <i>update_makefile.sh</i> runs in MSYS ( Win32 shell environment ) again, as intermediate use of perl commands is stopped
	- <b>2004-11-24:</b> Add driver for <b>Sontheim CAN cards</b> ( tested only with CANLPT; but as the generalized API is used, and all documented card specific differences are handled,
			there should be at least only the need for a little bit testing and bugfixing to get everyting to work with all current Sontheim cards )
	- <b>2004-12-03:</b> Finish heavy optimization of HEAP usage and optional exact documentation of HEAP usage during runtime via RS232, so that really needed HEAPSIZE can be derived
		( reduction of HEAPSIZE dependent on application can vary between 4 KByte and 10 KByte )
	- <b>2004-12-06:</b> Enable and test Win32 multithreading in Sontheim CAN driver ( as no Vector-Informatik CAN cards are accessible for the author, this can't be tested -> so multithreading is only active
			as default for Sontheim )
	- <b>2004-12-09:</b> As some so called "Extended EC++" compilers like IAR don't support multiple inheritance and additionally place their individual tailored version of STL
		<b>not</b> in the ANSI C++ conformant namespace <b>std</b> the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> was changed to <b>not use any multiple inheritance</b> and is now
		<b>flexible to retrieve STL elements from the namespace STL_NAMESPACE, which can be defined individual for each compiler in the header <i>compiler_adaptation.h</i></b><br>
		Therefore the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> is now usable for all compilers which use this "Extended EC++" subset of ANSI C++
	- <b>2004-12-10:</b> List of used C++ features which aren't mapped by simple <b>EC++</b> compilers which doesn't use the <b>Extended EC++</b> specification
		is written in \ref InfReqCompiler ( there are also some general notes on compiler use )
	- <b>2004-12-12:</b> Add tutorial examples for internal CAN, supplementary drivers eeprom, sensor and PWM
	- <b>2004-12-17:</b> Changed release number of next revision to 1.1.0 ( and not 1.0.1 ) as really a lot of things are corrected and extended
			( especially PC CAN driver, DOC, tutorial examples and virtual terminal )
	- <b>2005-01-11:</b> Preperation for 1.1.1 release:
			- rename driver for Vector-Informatik "XL Driver Library" from "vector_xl" to "vector_xl_drv_lib", to make difference between XL CAN cards and "XL Driver Library" clear
			- rename example program Taskcontroller to AutoDataCollector, to avoid misleading interpretation as ISO 11783 conformant Task-Controller which it is <b>clearly NOT</b>


\subsection News_a News before 1.0.0 release
	- Complete Toolchain for ISO 11783 Virtual Terminal is integrated.
	- <a href="http://www.fritzmeier.com/engl/frameset_engl.htm?/engl/environment/environment_miniveg.htm">Chlorophyll Sensor <b>MiniVeg N</b></a> -
	    the first commercial application of <a href="www.fritzmeier.de">Fritzmeier</a>
	    is developed based on ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>
	- Company <a href="www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> with the author of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> is providing commercial
	    service for ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> applications, project development based on ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> and other
			embedded services
	- ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> is still being developed in cooperation with research group of <b>Prof. Auernhammer</b>
	    at <a href="http://www.tec.wzw.tum.de/pflanztech/englisch/index.html">Department of Bio Resources and Land Use Technology - Crop Production Engineering</a>
	- ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> is now running also at ECU of <a href="http://www.mitron.fi">Mitron</a>
	- Directory structure and module structure of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> is completly reorganized, so that
	    optional and obligatory parts can be detected better, and the corresponding files for
			internal implementation and interface are tighter grouped.
	- Heavy extended documentation with information on every important part of the library
	    with example code lines and some diagrams.
	- <b>Changed license to <i>GPL with extension</i> which derived from the <i>eCos</i> license. This license has an explicit definition of
		allowed usage of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> which doesn't cause any license obligations on the using application.
		The original chosen LGPL license would require some inacceptable requirements to commercial applications.</b>
	- Shell script collects all needed source files based on a feature set definition in one small project spec file. Thus
		it is easy to avoid the inclusion of unneeded files. This shell script is also useable in Windows, as the
		Open Source tool <b>MSYS</b> provides a minimum but capable enough <b>POSIX</b> layer for Windows.
	- At least one very active and already contributing user from a well known manufacturer confirms, that ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>
		allows even the implementation of missing features after some work with it.
	- Each email adress in this project is intentionally corrupted, to make SPAMMING a little bit more complicated. Each human reader will easily detect how to
		"fix" the email adress - this "manipulation" might change if the maintainers detect that SPAM tools are able to derive automatically a
		working domain.
