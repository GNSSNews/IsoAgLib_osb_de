This page contains additional information on some topics that needed to be included but would bloat the specific parts of the documentation.

\section CompilingOnlyNeccessaryVtObjects Compiling only necessary vtObjects (new in version 2.1) 
An XML-pool usually does not use every existing vt-object.
Since each vtObject, that is compiled and linked unnecessarily, increases the 
size of the resulting object code and thus lowers the perfomance, vt2iso is 
now able to parse the XML files and look which XML-tags are used, and creates 
a new file "IsoTerminalObjectSelection.inc" that contains all necessary 
defines for the project. Since this is done automatically, the user normally 
does not have to bother about it.

In some rare cases, additional defines are needed even if they are not 
existing in any XML file. For that case, a new optional attribute in the 
<tt><objectpool></tt> tag has to be used:

</tt><objectpool ... additionally_required_objects="outputlist+outputstring" /></tt>

This way, vt2iso puts additional \#defines for outputlist and outputstring in 
the IsoTerminalObjectSelection.inc independent of the XML file itself.

To use this inc-file, its location has to be put in the conf-file. The section 
can look like this:

<tt>PRJ_ISO_TERMINAL_OBJECT_SELECTION1="MaskDefinition"</tt>

or 

<tt>PRJ_ISO_TERMINAL_OBJECT_SELECTION1="MaskDefinition/FirstPool"<br>
PRJ_ISO_TERMINAL_OBJECT_SELECTION2="MaskDefinition/SecondPool"</tt>

Up to four pools are supported for one client. If no update_makefile is used, 
the following line should be added to the <tt>config_MyProject</tt> - file:

\code
#ifndef PRJ_ISO_TERMINAL_OBJECT_SELECTION1 
    #define PRJ_ISO_TERMINAL_OBJECT_SELECTION1 MaskDefinition 
#endif
\endcode
In both cases, the folder is a relative destination from the source directory. <br>
<b>IMPORTANT:</b> If this information misses in the config file, the object code 
will keep at all moduls included, like in IsoAgLib 2.0.
