\section FurtherDevelopment Further Development
The ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> is published as Open Source according to the GPL license ( with exceptions ). Therefore everybody has the right
to use, to analyse and to change the source code, as long as the changes to the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> itself are provided
to the public with the same license conditions. Thus the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> could be used by a lot of manufacturers
without the fear of monopolistic control. This would allow the compatible use of all sophisticated features of
ISO 11783 for its machines. The author <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler@gmx:de">Achim Spangler</a> who is now working for
<a href="http://www.osb-ag.de/">OSB AG</a> can arrange service contracts to provide extensions and other service for the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>.

The ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> is used at the experimental station D&uuml;rnast to document the work of all tractor dependent work
including simple soil cultivation implements. Small computing devices, which are called "Implement Indicator" (IMI) were
developed for this purpose based on the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>. A ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>
 based Task-Controller records all available process data information from
the connected implements, combines them with GPS time and position data,
groups the data according to the areas farm, transport and field and stores
everything on PCMCIA memory cards. <br clear="All">

The work result with applicating implements like seeder can be optimized, if the ECU of the seeder can command the tractor

 to drive not faster than the machine construction allows dependent on the
wanted seed density and depth and environment conditions. A front mounted
power harrow could indirectly control the loosening of soil compaction (work
intensity), if it can define a relation between driving speed and RPM of
the Power Take off Output Shaft (PTO). Damage could be avoided, if the tractor
would additionally enable the definition of a maximum limit for the hubload
on the PTO axle. If the tractor finally enables the control of the front
EHR position, the power harrow can control the work depth. This can be used
by the seeder to guarantee suitable soil conditions for the needed seeding
depth.<br>
The ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> supports this interactions with its capable process data implementation. Limits can be
defined as MIN or MAX setpoint. Parallel setpoints for the driving speed can by handled by the tractor, if it is based on the
ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>.

A modular extendable network for the fertilizer dosing can be also realized based on the process data features of the
ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>. Most of the actual sold systems with LBS (DIN 9684) aware fertilizers consist only of functions
\image html Diagramme/fertiliser_control_collaboration.gif
to control the application rate with a standard terminal or with application maps. But the latter is derived from
static information like yield maps, so that environmental conditions of the actual year are not integrated.<br>
Some systems utilize a spectroscopic sensor to detect the amount of chlorophyll in the plants. As long as the shortage
of chlorophyll is mainly caused by a shortage of nitrogen in the soil, the application rate dosing based on a standalone
sensor is correct. But chlorophyll shortage can also be caused by water stress and other conditions.<br>
Therefore additional moisture sensors and data bases have to be developed in future to avoid a false nitrogen dosing.
All these information sources should be evaluated by a mobile expert system, which could send an ultimate
nitrogen application rate setpoint to the fertilizer.<br>
Most of these devices have to be developed in future. Therefore a farmer should have the possibility to simply
integrate new devices in an existing network, without changing the existing elements.<br>
This is possible, if some basic strategies are used by all devices:
- use setpoint intervals in favour of exact values
- provide sensored values as process data (e.g. a chlorophyll sensor which only sends application rate setpoints can't be
		used by a mobile expert system as information source)
- interprete setpoints which are sent by other devices
- fertilizer&nbsp;should ask the driver for a priority ranking of different conflicting setpoint sender (this ranking should
		be stored for future use)
