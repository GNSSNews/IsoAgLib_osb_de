\section ContactInformation Contact Information
Support requests going further than what can be found on this website can be directed to <a href="mailto:m.wodok@osb:de">Martin Wodok</a> at <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB-AG</a>. <a href="mailto:m.wodok_at_osb:de">Martin Wodok</a>. To receive help for other specific problems please use the \ref Mailing-Lists or get in touch with Achim Spangler otherwise.

\section Mailing-List
Like every other Open Source Project \isoaglib lives through its active community.
You can direct your help requests to the community of \isoaglib users and developers, as well.
Therefore the <a href="http://projects.osb-ag.de/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/isoaglib">ISOAgLib-mailing-list</a> has been established, You can subscribe there (via HTTP or HTTPS) or just send an email to <a href="mailto:isoaglib@projects:osb-ag:de">isoaglib@projects:osb-ag:de</a> (please replace the colons by dots). This way all users can help each other without the dependency on the maintainers. 
New feature wishes, bug reports and other change suggestions can be discussed there, too.
Please note that all important changes/announcements are done via this mailing-list.

Please keep in mind, that you might be one time the helping party, while you could need help from another user the other time.<br>
Please keep this also in mind, if the company name in the email address of the asking user is not one of your best friends - maybe he can help you another time also.

\section Contributing Contributing to the IsoAgLib Project
Each Open Source project needs the input of an active user community to get optimal results.
Herby not only source code contributions are needed. For example tutorial examples and documentation text
could be enhanced, corrected and extended by users who don't feel familiar enough to contribute code.

All authors will be listed in the file(s) where they contributed (please prepare this in your patches), and at the \ref Authors "Authors' and Contributors' section" on the main entry page</a> of \isoaglib.
Each fundamental change like a licensing change will be only performed, if none of the source code authors and contributors
raise their veto. Licensing changes might be needed, if some projects or users would be prevented from the use of \isoaglib.
But also fundamental changes in the design and structure of \isoaglib will be discussed with the authors (as far as they are still active and
reachable).

Please take a look at the \ref PageTodo page for a brief overview on contribution topics.

Your contributions can be integrated into the repository if you work as described:
- Use Subversion or one of its GUI Tools (e.g. TortoiseSVN) to create a local working copy
- Update your repository (especially important for creation of diffs) with
    the command "svn update" (or one of the corresponding commands in GUI tools)
- Collect all changes with the command "svn diff" (or one of its corresponding commands in GUI tools; e.g. TortoiseSVN provides a command "Create Patch...")
    into one patch
- Send the patch to <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler_at_osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a>
    for inclusion (evaluation of the change is then a lot easier)<br>

If you perform local changes at your local "Working Copy" (that's the result of a checkout), subversion might
detect <b>conflicts</b> during one of the next updates, if your local changes intersect with some changes in the
repository. Subversion (like CVS) will preserve both versions of the affected <b>lines</b>, so that you can manually
decide on the "right" merge. If you don't detect such a conflict, you might be irritated by some syntax error messages from your compiler
or you might get some execution errors on shell scripts like <tt>update_makefile.sh</tt>. This is caused by the way subversion presents both
versions within the affected file. 
You might look <a href="http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/ch05s06.html">here</a> for more
information on the markers which are used to show conflicts (comparable to CVS).<br>
Subversion will create unchanged copies of your last base version, the current version from repository and your personal changed file,
so that you can also simply continue to use yours (<tt>foo.mine</tt>) or the newest (<tt>foo.rNN</tt> - <tt>NN</tt> the number of the current version) version.
Please remove the files like <tt>foo.mine</tt> and <tt>foo.rNN</tt> to indicate to subversion that you resolved the conflict.<br>
<b>TortoiseSVN</b> helps you to detect conflicts, as it highlights the corresponding filename in its work state dialog window, where the
process of an update is logged. It indicates also files where it was able to perform a clean merge of local and repository changes. 
But you might also have a look in these files to make verify that the merge was really clean (the maintainers of \isoaglib didn't have
such problems so far).

\section GeneralSupportInformation General Support Information
Even if \isoaglib provides very detailed documentation including several <b>HOWTO</b> chapters, the learning effort to get a tutorial example running is not completly neglectible (reading the documentation requires at least some time).
Additionally the <i>object oriented</i> development style might be new to most of the potential users.

\subsection Workshop Tutorial Workshops for Development with IsoAgLib
Please contact <a href="mailto:m.rothmund@osb-ag:de">Matthias Rothmund</a> to
request and plan workshops where all members can learn:
    - <b>XML</b> design and definition of <b>ISO 11783 Virtual Terminal</b> mask pools
    - possibilities to create flexible mask definitions which can be automatically adapted by the \isoaglib to the properties of the connected terminal:
        - multi-language string handling
        - scaling to screen size
        - selection of available font size that is corresponding to the scaling factor of the complete layout
        - colour depth selection during runtime, so that a unique global mask pool can be defined.
    - integration of <b>IDE</b> of choice (some project file format types are automatically supported)
    - integration of <b>ISO 11783</b> communication with existing application code (ways to define interface modules)
    - integration of process data management to allow terminal independent control and monitoring access to an implement
    - adaptation to individual target platform (creation of corresponding <b>H</b>ardware <b>A</b>bstraction <b>L</b>ayer - HAL)
    - test of application with the <b>R</b>ealtime <b>T</b>est <b>E</b>nvironment (RTE), which is another also Open Source
        project of <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> for test of embedded applications (not only useable for ISO 11783 networks)
    - ...

The exact topics of a tutorial workshop can be defined corresponding to the request of
interested developers.

\subsection HalAdaptation Support for Adaptation to an Individual Target Platform
Even if the adaptation of \isoaglib to an individual target platform (OS or BIOS) is eased
by the compact HAL definition, <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> can offer support for this adaptation or can perform the
complete adaptation. Please contact <a href="mailto:m.rothmund@osb-ag:de">Matthias Rothmund</a> for more details.

\subsection SupportContract Support Contract
Like other Open Source projects, the maintainers can provide some free support, which is restricted by
the spare free time of the developers and other experts in the user community. For commercial users, who need a predefined
reaction time for each issue (question or bug report), should contact <a href="mailto:m.rothmund@osb-ag:de">Matthias Rothmund</a> to arrange a commercial project contact.

\subsection CommercialEdition Commercial Editions
The business model of \isoaglib is comparable to <b>Red Hat</b> with their free
<b><a href="http://www.fedora-linux.org/">Fedora Linux</a></b> and their commercial grade
<b><a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat Enterprise</a></b> edition.
While the versions of the free \isoaglib edition are good working snapshots of the ongoing development,
the commercial edition provides thoroughly tested and maintained versions (including bug fixes for older revisions).
Please get in touch with <a href="mailto:m.rothmund@osb-ag:de">Matthias Rothmund</a> to retrieve more information.

\subsection FeaturesOnRequest Integration of Requested Features
As long as <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> maintains the \isoaglib, all received
patches will be reviewed and merged into the reference version of the software. Additionally all feature
extensions, which are needed for projects of <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> will also be merged.<br>

But as the ISO 11783 standard definition contains a lot of functions, which are not needed for the own
projects of the \isoaglib maintainers, they will be only integrated if other users contribute them, or if
<a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> is asked to develop them. This is also true for several enhancements of ISO Virtual Terminal mask definitions, which
would enable a more capable and more flexible adaptation to the features of the connected terminal. <br>
Some examples:
    - GUI tool to define the XML mask definition (easier than edit of pure ASCII)
    - individual rules for selection of bitmap version in relation to size and color depth of connected
        terminal
    - extension of the font size relative positioning to map different font sizes for different
        language versions (languages where all labels a longer than the corresponding strings in other
        languages might need a smaller font size to allow placement on the common layout;
        therefore font size dependent position alignment should be enhanced)
    - language specific bitmaps (especially if some text is displayed in the bitmap)
