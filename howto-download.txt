\section HowtoDownload Downloading the Needed Archives

As the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> provides several functions which are supplementary
or only relevant for specific conditions, the download is seperated in several
parts.

<table class="download" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">

The supplementary drivers were developed to control complete ECU IO in object oriented style
with ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> . This development patterns allows the combined control and diagnose
of IO channels with One-Channel-One-Instance relation. These driver extensions are complete optional.

All archives should be extracted from the same directory.

\subsection HowtoCreateDoc Rebuilding the Documentation with Doxygen

If you don't want to download the big archive with the generated documentation
( <b>13 MByte</b> ), you can simply recreate the documentation based on the downloaded
source and the contained informative text files.
<b>Steps:</b><ol>
<li>Download and install Doxygen from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ for your specific plattform
<li>Download and install graphviz with the tool "dot" from http://www.graphviz.org/Download.php
<li>Let Doxygen create the documentation with the config file "Doxyfile" which is located in the project root directory
</ol>


\section HowtoAccessRepository Accessing the Version Management Repository
The sources of the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> managed by the version management system
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion</a> which is developed as a replacement for CVS.
The ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> repository can be accessed in read-only mode with anonymous access, so that no
registration is needed.

	- HTTP:
		- HEAD: <a href="http://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/IsoAgLib">http://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/IsoAgLib</a>
		- Releases: <a href="http://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/releases">http://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/releases</a>
	- HTTPS:
		- HEAD: <a href="https://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/IsoAgLib">https://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/IsoAgLib</a>
		- Releases: <a href="https://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/releases">https://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/releases</a>

You can access the repository by:
	- normal Browser (<a href="http://www.isoaglib.org/svn/OSB/IsoAgLib/IsoAgLib">directly use the links above</a>)
	- with command line tools of Subversion
	- with GUI tools like rapidsvn and TortoiseSVN ( integration in Windows File Manager for very easy
		version management access )
		which can be downloaded from <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org">Subversion Webiste</a> .<br>
		<b>Important:</b><br>
		Please make sure that you select the option to enable usage by all users on computer during install, as this seems to be
		no default option. Otherwise you can't use it as ordinary user on WinXP, WinNT or Win2000.<br>


<b>What to do on access problems:</b><br>
Please look at the <a href="https://linux90.idvnet.de/pipermail/isoaglib/">email list (HTTPS)</a> to see, if your problem is known.
In case your problem differs from already known cases, you should subscribe to the email list and post there your problem report.<br>
If you can only access Internet through a proxy, you have to configure subversion ( or your GUI frontend like TortoiseSVN ) to use your
proxy. See the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/svn-book.html">manual</a> for more information on
the use of subversion.<br>
If your company proxy blocks the needed WebDAV commands by default, and you can't use HTTPS for some reasons, you might look at
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/project_faq.html%23proxy#proxy">there</a> for a description of the needed WebDAV commands. Maybe
you can ask your proxy administrator to allow these commands to pass thru.


\section HowtoContribute Contributing to the Project
Each Open Source project needs the input of an active user community to get optimal results.
Herby not only source code contributions are needed. For example tutorial examples and documentation text
could be enhanced, corrected and extended by users who don't feell familiar engough to contribute code.

All authors will be listed in the file(s) where they contributed ( please prepare this in your patches ), and at the main page ( this page )
of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> <a href="index.html#Authors">HERE</a>.
Each fundamental change like a licensing change will be only performed, if none of the source code authors and contributors
raise their veto. Licensing changes might be needed, if some projects or users would be prevented from the us of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>.
But also fundamental changes in the design and structure of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> will be discussed with the authors (as far as they are still active and
reachable).

Your contributions can be integrated into the repository if you work as described:
- Use Subversion or one of its GUI Tools (e.g. TortoiseSVN) to create a local working copy
- Update your repository ( especially important for creation of diffs ) with
	the command "svn update" ( or one of the corresponding commands in GUI tools )
- Collect all changes with the command "svn diff" ( or one of its corresponding commands in GUI tools; e.g. TortoiseSVN provides a command "Create Patch..." )
	into one patch
- Send the patch to <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler@osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a>
	for inclusion ( evaluation of the change is then a lot easier )<br>

If you perform local changes at your local "Working Copy" ( that's the result of a checkout ), subversion might
detect <b>conflicts</b> during one of the next updates, if your local changes intersect with some changes in the
repository. Subversion ( like CVS ) will preserve both versions of the affected <b>lines</b>, so that you can manually
decide on the "right" merge. If you don't detect such a conflict, you might be irritated by some syntax error messages from your compiler
or you might get some execution errors on shell scripts like update_makefile.sh . This is caused by the way Subversion presents the both
versions within the affected file. You might look <a href="http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/ch05s06.html">here</a> for more
information on the markers which are used to show conflicts ( comparable to CVS ).<br>
Subversion will create unchanged copies of your last base version, the current version from repository and your personal changed file,
so that you can also simply continue to use yours ( foo.mine ) or the newest ( foo.rNN - NN the number of the current version ) version.
Please remove the files like foo.mine and foo.rNN to indicate to subversion that you resolved the conflict.<br>
<b>TortoiseSVN</b> helps you to detect conflicts, as it highlights the corresponding filename in its work state dialog window, where the
process of an update is logged. It indicates also files where it was able to perform a clean merge of local and repository changes. But you might also
have a look in these files to, to make shure, the merge was really clean ( the maintainers of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> didn't have
such problems so far  ).

\section HowtoGetHelp Getting Help
As this is an Open Source project, not only the maintainers of the project can provide sufficient help for all users <b>free of charge</b>.
So either you sign a support contract to get personal support.<br>
Or you direct your help requests to the community of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> users and developers, who can be reached by the <a href="http://linux90.idvnet.de/pipermail/isoaglib/">email list</a>
or <a href="https://linux90.idvnet.de/pipermail/isoaglib/">email list (HTTPS)</a>
( subscribe <a href="http://linux90.idvnet.de/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/isoaglib">here</a> or <a href="https://linux90.idvnet.de/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/isoaglib">there (HTTPS)</a>
and send mail <a href="mailto:isoaglib@linux90:idvnet:de">there</a> ). This way all users can help each other
without the dependency on the maintainers. New feature wishes, bug reports and other change suggestions can be discussed there, too.<br>
Please keep in mind, that you might be one time the helping party, while you could need help from another user the other time.<br>
Please keep this also in mind, if the company name in the email address of the asking user is not one of your best friends - maybe he can help you another time also.<br>
This works really fine in several other Open  Source projects.
