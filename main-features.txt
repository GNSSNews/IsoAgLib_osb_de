\section MainFeatures Main Features
The ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> is designed to provide the following main features
(read \ref InfGeneralInformation for more information):
- perform all tasks which can be automated in the background so that the application development is simplified
		and different interpretation of low level communication (like message formatting) is avoided
- provide <b>complete Open Source toolchain for ISO 11783 development - including virtual terminal</b> <br>
	Masks are defined with XML notation, which is then converted to ROM-enabled variable arrays which are then
	included in an object module of the project. ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> provides a simple function call
	to register the mask pool. ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> performs then some runtime adaptation to terminal properties
	( choose usable colour depth of bitmaps, scaling, including handling of cases where
	layout properties like text alignment should be conserved even if no font of scaled size is available ) and finishes this process
	by an automatic upload of the adapted pool. Already active pools can be handled with simple access functions for control,
	and some easy handler functions for reaction on user input.<br>
	<b>Core target of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> Virtual Terminal design:</b><br>
	- Enable creation of one single mask pool, that fits all terminal configurations
	- Provide attributes for project specific control of the runtime adaptation
	- Allow flexible addition of further attributes, if automatic layout control must be optimized for some terminal properties ( e.g. amount of softkeys )

	All these actions are demonstrated in the tutorial example \ref 3_0_VirtualTerminalIso.cpp .<br>
	&nbsp;<br>
	Brad Cox developed a tool for his company, that is able to convert the project files of the WTK mask generator to the XML definition.
	Please contact <a href="mailto:Achim.Spangler@osb-ag:de">Achim Spangler</a> if you are interested in this tool for your own use, as Brad
	Cox indicated already, that he might be willing to provide this undest some conditions. <br>
	But this tool would only help to start the virtual mask definition with XML, as this method provides some additional attributes to
	control the automatic runtime adaptation of the single core mask pool to the different terminal properties ( e.g. font size dependent spacing ).
- provide flexible and capable process data implementation as backbone for all documenting and control interaction
		(e.g. trigger dependent measurement value send, allow setpoint intervals with MIN / MAX,
		enable N --&gt; 1 relation between user and provider of process data)
- narrow hardware adaptation afford to small set of files with hardware adaptation layer
- greatest part of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> source code can be used without any changes for different platforms
- enable project specific feature selection, source code maintenance and extension by strict modular design
- facilitate development of application for ISO 11783
- orientate design according to requirements of networks with more then two devices
