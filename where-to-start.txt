\section WhereToStart  Where to Start Learning IsoAgLib
\subsection GettingOverview Where to Get an Overview
The links in the navigation column present you the following information:
	- Get short information on ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> and its structural design at \ref MainFeatures and \ref StructuralOverview
	- Get some insight on the design goals of the complete system at \ref InfGeneralInformation , \ref InfAgentNetwork and \ref InfServiceNetwork
	- Check ease of application development in an example for virtual terminal handling at 3_0_VirtualTerminalIso.cpp
			( other examples at <a href="examples.html">tutorial examples</a> page )

\subsection StartToLearn Where to Start Learning the IsoAgLib
Please have a close look at all HOWTO chapters which are presented in the navigation column.
	- read at least some of the <a href="examples.html">tutorial examples</a> which are organized in groups ( first number ) and read some of the referenced further documentation:
		- Nr. 0 for simple applications which demonstrate management of ECU as device node at the network
		- Nr. 1 for simple applications which demonstrate usage of base data like tractor speed and distance
		- Nr. 2 for several levels of applications which demonstrate use of process data value exchange ( measurement data for monitoring and setpoint setting for control )
		- Nr. 3 for two examples of terminal handling: <b>ISO 11783 virtual terminal</b>
	- check for modules which you should download to get the features you want at \ref HowtoDownload
	- check for pointers at documentation overview pages of the core features of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> at \ref HowtoLearnIsoAgLib
	- check for installation instructions of vt2iso , a tool to convert XML mask definition to ROM-eable constant variable definition modules at \ref InstallIsoToolVt2Iso
		( <b>you don't have to compile it at Win32, as an EXE is also part of the archive</b> )
	- check for instructions to create IDE project files for applications at \ref HowtoCreateProjectFiles ( the presented shell script does the very important and
		rather complicated job of selecting the needed source files for the wanted features of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> )

\subsection FurtherRead Further Documentation
Please read at least on the long run most of the pages which are directly referenced by the navigation column on this first page.
The overview pages referenced by \ref HowtoLearnIsoAgLib present several example snippets for the classes which correspond to the described
feature group. The most important classes have also some detailed information on their features and usage.<br>
<b>Important:</b><br>
All elements with names without "i" at the beginning and which are grouped to the namespaces __IsoAgLib and __HAL are only interesting for experts who want to learn the internals of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>.
But please be warned, that this stuff seems rather complicated if you are not familiar with object oriented design. You can be assured, that not only the authors of
the architecture accept the high quality of design. Some parts might look strange at the first sight - but then you will detect that such elements are very helpful
for reduction of code duplication and ease of code maintenance. One example is the Singleton Pattern, which is used for global, but well defined to core service classes
like IsoAgLib::IsoTerminal_c. The use of this template guarantees that event the first access is always performed at a correct initialised instance. Even if the initialisation of a core
service class depends of the previous initialisation of one or more other classes, the correct order of initialisation is realized.<br>

some parts, even after reading the presented documentation.
