Win32 Installation Instructions
===============================
There's already a ready to run version of proc2iso.exe present in .\bin that can 
be used.

However, the easiest way to compile proc2iso directly from the sources is using 
the included Dev-C++ project file (proc2iso.dev). Therefore you need to have the
additional packages xerces (2.5.0.122) and freeimage added to your Dev-C++ 
installation. The already compiled version was created using this development
environment and therefore ONLY works correctly with the xerces-c_2_5_0.dll that 
is included within this package.


Parsing device descriptions using proc2iso.exe
==============================================
proc2iso.exe needs a specified xml schema file as parameter. You can use the 
included proc2iso.xsd file or specify a different one.

usage:
  proc2iso.exe -s=[ful relative path to fobar.xsd] [XML device description file]
or:
  call "proc2iso.cmd" directly from where your [device description].xml file is
  stored and the proc2iso.xsd that is in the same directory as proc2iso.exe will
  be used by default.

Please note that specifying an absolute path within the parameters of 
proc2iso.exe might not work (so just use the batch file)!


Further Information
===================
Please also take a closer look at the INSTALL file for further information on 
the proc2iso setup.
