 * This file is part of the "IsoAgLib", an object oriented program library *
 * to serve as a software layer between application specific program and   *
 * communication protocol details. By providing simple function calls for  *
 * jobs like starting a measuring program for a process data value on a    *
 * remote ECU, the main program has not to deal with single CAN telegram   *
 * formatting. This way communication problems between ECU's which use     *
 * this library should be prevented.                                       *
 * Everybody and every company is invited to use this library to make a    *
 * working plug and play standard out of the printed protocol standard.    *
 *                                                                         *

 * Each software module, which accesses directly elements of this file,    *
 * is considered to be an extension of IsoAgLib and is thus covered by the *
 * GPL license. Applications must use only the interface definition out-   *
 * side :impl: subdirectories. Never access direct elements of __IsoAgLib  *
 * and __HAL namespaces from applications which shouldnt be affected by    *
 * the license. Only access their interface counterparts in the IsoAgLib   *
 * and HAL namespaces. Contact a.spangler@osb-ag:de in case your applicat- *
 * ion really needs access to a part of an internal namespace, so that the *
 * interface might be extended if your request is accepted.                *
 *                                                                         *
 * Definition of direct access:                                            *
 * - Instantiation of a variable with a datatype from internal namespace   *
 * - Call of a (member-) function                                          *
 * Allowed is:                                                             *
 * - Instatiation of a variable with a datatype from interface namespace,  *
 *   even if this is derived from a base class inside an internal namespace*
 * - Call of member functions which are defined in the interface class     *
 *   definition ( header )                                                 *

 * Pairing of internal and interface classes:                              *
 * - Internal implementation in an :impl: subdirectory                     *
 * - Interface in the parent directory of the corresponding internal class *
 * - Interface class name IsoAgLib::iFoo_c maps to the internal class      *
 *   __IsoAgLib::Foo_c                                                     *
