\section Support Support Possibilities
Even if the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> provides very detailed documentation including several <b>HOWTO</b> chapters with
important starting information, the learning afford to get a running tutorial example is not completly neglectible ( reading the documentation
requires at least some time ). Additionally the <b>object oriented</b> development style might be new to most of the potential users.<br>

\subsection Workshop Tutorial Workshops for Development with IsoAgLib
Please visit our <a href="http://www.isoaglib.com/contact.html">commercial project contact page</a> to
request and plan workshops where all members can learn:
	- <b>XML</b> design and definition of <b>ISO 11783 Virtual Terminal</b> mask pools
	- possibilities to create flexible mask definitions which can be automatically adapted by the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> to the properties of the connected terminal:
		- multi-language string handling
		- scaling to screen size
		- selection of available font size that is corresponding to the scaling factor of the complete layout
		- colour depth selection during runtime, so that a unique global mask pool can be defined.
	- integration of <b>IDE</b> of choice ( some project file format types are automatically supported )
	- integration of <b>ISO 11783</b> communication with existing application code ( ways to define interface modules )
	- integration of process data management to allow terminal independent control and monitoring access to an implement
	- adaptation to individual target platform ( creation of corresponding <b>H</b>ardware <b>A</b>bstraction <b>L</b>ayer - HAL )
	- test of application with the <b>R</b>ealtime <b>T</b>est <b>E</b>nvironment ( RTE ), which is another also Open Source
		project of <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> for test of embedded applications ( not only useable for ISO 11783 networks )
	- ...

The exact topics of a tutorial workshop can be defined corresponding to the request of
interested developers.

\subsection HalAdaptation Support for Adaptation to Individual Target Platform
Even if the adaptation of the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> to an individual target platform ( OS or BIOS ) is eased
by the compact HAL definition, <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> can offer support for this adaptation or can perform the
complete adaptation. Please use our <a href="http://www.isoaglib.com/contact.html">commercial project contact page</a> for more details.

\subsection SupportContract Support Contract
Like other Open Source projects, the maintainers can provide some free support, which is restricted by
the spare free time of the developers and other experts in the user community. For commercial users, who need a predefined
reaction time for each issue ( question or bug report ), should check our <a href="http://www.isoaglib.com/contact.html">commercial project contact page</a>.

\subsection CommercialEdition Commercial Editions
The business model of ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> is comparable to <b>Red Hat</b> with their <i>free</i>
<b><a href="http://www.fedora-linux.org/">Fedora Linux</a></b> and their commercial grade
<b><a href="http://www.redhat.com/">Red Hat Enterprise</a></b> edition.
While the versions of the free ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> edition are good working snapshots of the ongoing development,
the commercial edition provides thoroughly tested and maintained (including bug fixes for older revisions) versions.
Please check our <a href="http://www.isoaglib.com/contact.html">commercial project contact page</a> to retrieve more information.

\subsection FeaturesOnRequest Integration of Requested Features
As long as <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> maintains the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i>, all received
patches will be reviewed and merged into the reference version of the software. Additionally all feature
extensions, which are needed for projects of <a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> will also be merged.<br>

But as the ISO 11783 standard definition contains a lot of functions, which are not needed for the own
projects of the ISO<i><sub>AgLib</sub></i> maintainers, they will be only integrated if other users contribute them, or if
<a href="http://www.osb-ag.de">OSB AG</a> is asked to develop them. This is also true for several enhancements of ISO Virtual Terminal mask definitions, which
would enable a more capable and more flexible adaptation to the features of the connected terminal. <br>
Some examples:
	- GUI tool to define the XML mask definition ( easier than edit of pure ASCII )
	- individual rules for selection of bitmap version in relation to size and color depth of connected
		terminal
	- extension of the font size relative positioning to map different font sizes for different
		language versions ( languages where all labels a longer than the corresponding strings in other
		languages might need a smaller font size to allow placement on the common layout;
		therefore font size dependent position alignment should be enhanced )
	- language specific bitmaps ( especially if some text is displayed in the bitmap )
